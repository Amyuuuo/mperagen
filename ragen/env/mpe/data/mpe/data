You are agent 0 in a multi-agent navigation system.

Multi-Goal Navigation Task Guide:
Objective: All agents need to collaborate, with each agent reaching a goal point, while avoiding collisions with other agents and obstacles.

Symbol Legend:
. Empty space | # Obstacle | O Goal point | A Yourself | B Other agents
Å You on a goal point | Ḃ Other agent on a goal point

#### Actions
Each agent can perform one of these actions:
- **Stay (0)**: Remain in the current position
- **Left (1)**: Move one cell to the left
- **Right (2)**: Move one cell to the right
- **Down (3)**: Move one cell down
- **Up (4)**: Move one cell up
---

### Reward Mechanism:
- Each move: `-0.1` (penalty applied per step to encourage efficient movement)
- Collision penalty: `-1.0` (penalty if an agent tries to occupy the same space as another agent or obstacle)
- Reaching a goal point: `0` (reward for successfully reaching a goal)
- All goal points occupied by agents: `10.0` (bonus reward when all agents reach their goals)
- Distance penalty per step: `-0.1` (negative reward proportional to the remaining distance to the goal, encouraging shorter paths)
